# Contenda Takehome
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for checking out this repository. To make sure you're in the right place, this is the repo for the following jobs:

> [Senior NLP Engineer](https://jobs.wrk.xyz/contenda/25040)


The goal of this assignment is to evaluate a candidate's ability to pick up knowledge quickly, iterate on the existing resources, commuicate through writing, and be creative around business problems. Please don't spend more than 3 hours on this.

If you have any questions, please email lilly@contenda.co.

## Task
In this Python notebook, we've set up a base function for training an LDA model using `gensim`. There's a folder called `/training_transcriptions` in a `.txt` format for you to train your model.

We want you to train a topic model that can identify meaningful topics given a new transcript. There's a folder called `/testing_transcriptions` for you to evaluate your model. 

Return your results however you want! It can be just a writeup, a graph, a table, or examples. Whatever you think is best! 

## Data Context
The transcriptions are done by a human for a technical video. Here are some examples of the [original videos](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/episodes). There *shouldn't* be any mistakes where a word like `Nuxt.js` is mistranscribed as `Nuts just`. 

## Setup
1. Fork this repo
2. Run this Jupyter notebook locally and install the necessary dependencies

## Submission
Send a link to your forked repo to lilly@contenda.co. Please answer the following questions:
1. How did you allocate your time?
2. What are the tradeoffs between training a model on transcripts as a corpus versus written articles?
3. What is something you'd like to try if you had another 8 hours? 3 days? 1 week?
4. What are the tradeoffs between using LDA for topic modeling vs other methods?
